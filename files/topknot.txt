Yes! I would love to do that. I visited your sites:
https://www.instagram.com/topknotchgreekapparel/
https://www.topknotchgreekapparel.com/s/shop

. I love this Phi Nu Pi Achievement shirt in RED (Size 2X).

I am currently shooting a video called "4 Evar Young".
It will include 
. speeches from FOUR Grand Polemarchs and Nephew Tommy endorsing my skills as Official Kanemaster
. video footage of movies, music videos, and cane achievements: https://CaneFreestyle.com/drew
. I have been solicited by two museums to submit artifacts (and that will be in the video)
. I will be using FOUR canes the entire time (including 4 canes blindfolded on a unicycle)
. The theme is "live like you're forever young" (and that I will never quit twirlin')

. I could shoot a topknotchgreekapparel commercial or wear your shirt in 4 Evar Young
My goal is to make the "4 Evar Young" video "legendary". After it gets done, I will promote it very heavily.

Competition
I do not want to participate in the competition. It's better to have young Nupes win.
Here is the video that I would have submitted (just so you can see it):

That is not the final edit; I'm going to add some words to it and fix the color a bit.

Promotion
We should have a phone call and consider collaborating: 404-234-1252
I am a software developer and I'm currently developing software to promote on TikTok and Instagram.
I will also promote on Youtube.
I like how you are regrowing the yonupes page and perhaps we can work together.

CaneFreestyle.com
I added some new code to CaneFreestyle.com TODAY.
The new code allows me to display FULL PAGE ads!
Every 10th time someone clicks the CaneFreestyle.com page, they are forwarded to an ad page.
I'm not trying to profit from CaneFreestyle.com; Ad revenue can be used to pay to promote the site.
My goal is to simply have one site with ALL the cane freestyle performances on the Internet.
And, I'd like 10,000 visiters a day (or more).
I have 20 - 30 hours of "long lost", "secret", and unreleased footage.
It will be added to the site (using unlisted Youtube links) so people must use the site to see.

Of course, every time you add a cane freestyle video to yonupes, I'll try to promote it directly!

Reality Show
Several people in the industry have said I should make a reality show about being Kanemaster.
I am currently working with a professional to produce the show.
