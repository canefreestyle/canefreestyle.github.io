                    Dear Vernon,<br>
                    Back when I crossed at Mu Chapter in Fall 1993, the Grand Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi was opposed to cane freestyle.<br>
                    Grand Polemarchs Ullysses McBride and Robert L. Harris openly opposed the use of canes and told Nupes to "focus on academics".<br>
                    The fundamental purpose of Kappa is Achievement in <i>EVERY</i> honorable field of human endeavor.<br>
                    However, historically, Grand Chapter has lauded achievement in every field . . . <i>except</i> cane freestyle.

                    <p>For the past 30 years, I have been slowly working towards giving the cane freestyle artform more credibility.</p>

                    Here are some of the endorsements I have received so far:
                    <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/aEnB9bRRysE?t=13" target=_blank>Grand Polemarch Rueben Shelton proclaiming I am the "G.O.A.T." "Greatest Of All Time"</a></li>
                

                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/aEnB9bRRysE?t=36" target=_blank>Grand Polemarch Randy Bates proclaiming I am the "First Official Kanemaster of Kappa"</a></li>

                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/aEnB9bRRysE?t=220" target=_blank>Grand Polemarch Dwayne Murray proclaiming I am the "First Crowned Kanemaster for the first century of Kappa"</a></li>

                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/aEnB9bRRysE?t=272" target=_blank>Grand Polemarch Dwayne Murray proclaiming I am the "the best"</a></li>

                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/aEnB9bRRysE?t=283" target=_blank>Grand Polemarch Robert L Harris Murray proclaiming I am "Masterful"</a></li>

                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/aEnB9bRRysE?t=310" target=_blank>FUTURE Grand Polemarch Robert Jenkins proclaiming I am "The Greatest of All Time" and I must be our "First Kanemaster Emeritus"</a></li>

                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/aEnB9bRRysE?t=346" target=_blank>Nephew Tommy proclaiming I am the winner of (The Nephew Tommy Kanemaster Competition)</a></li>

                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/aEnB9bRRysE?t=370" target=_blank>Tiwa Works proclaiming I am "First Official Atlanta Greek Picnic Competition Winner</a></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>To be the "Greatest Of All Time" in any field simply means to have "the most overall Achievement".<br>
                    Here is a partial list of my <a href="https://CaneFreestyle.com/drew" target=_blank>achievements in cane freestyle</a>.</p>
                    
                    How can you know that there is no one better?<br>
                    I collected <a href="https://CaneFreestyle.com" target=_blank>thousands of cane performance videos and linked to them from one website</a>.<br>
                    That way, you are able compare me to "everyone else" and see if there is anyone better.<br>
                    Here I <a href="https://youtu.be/aEnB9bRRysE" target=_blank>perform with 6 canes while riding a unicycle</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpGEws1U1Pw" target=_blank>with one cane using no hands</a>.

                    <p>It would be a HUGE honor for me if you would endorse me too!!! I see you as true Nupe.</p>

                    <p>Please send me a video of you saying something like this:</p>

                    "Vernon Jones here, Charter Member of the Stone Mountain Alumni Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.<br>
                    Back in 1995, Frank Redding and I spotted Drew twirling a cane on a street corner.<br>
                    I pulled over and reclaimed Drew on the spot!<br>
                    He was the first Kanemaster of Stone Mountain Alumni, and now, when it comes to the cane, he is the Greatest Of All Time!<br>
                    Congratulations, Drew Brown on 30 years of Achievement in Cane Freestyle!<br>
                    Yo!!!"<br>

                    <p>I intend to add your testimonial to a video called "Four Ever Young" that will show 30 years of highlights.<br>
                    It will feature me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwQg4pZshTY" target=_blank>freestyling four canes</a> (as you can see me doing here in front of Stone Mountain).<br>

                    <p>Soon I will solicit the current Grand Polemarch to sign a proclamation recognizing cane freestyle officially.</p>

                    Yours In the Bond,<br>
